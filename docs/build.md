# Build

[![CircleCI](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/gliderlabs/docker-alpine/release.svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/gliderlabs/docker-alpine)

A convenience `build` script is included that builds the image and runs basic tests against the resulting image tags. The script is used in the continuous integration process (check out the CircleCI badge link above). But you can run this script locally to build your own images. Be sure to check out the environment variables that can be tweaked at the top of the `build` script file.

## Image

### Builder

The image is built using a builder Docker container based on the `debian` image. This builder image lives in the `builder` sub-directory of the project and uses a `mkimage-alpine.sh` script to generate an Alpine Linux `rootfs.tar.gz` file. This file then gets copied to the root of the project so we can build the main Alpine Linux image by just using the `ADD` command to automatically untar the components to the resulting image.

### Options

The build script takes a glob of `options` files as an argument. Each of these files lives in a folder that describes the version of Alpine Linux to build. Each line of the `options` file are the options that will be applied to the resulting image. By default, we use the included glob of `versions/**/options`.

### Example

To build all the images simply run:

```console
$ ./build
```

Pass version files to the `build` script to build specific versions:

```console
$ ./build version/library-3.2/options versions/stock-3.2/options
```

With `parallel` available you can speed up building a bit:

```console
$ parallel -m ./build ::: versions/**/options
```

## Testing

The test for images is very simple at the moment. It just attempts to install the `openssl` package and verify we exit cleanly.

Use the `test` sub-command of the `build` utility to run tests on currently build images (`build test`).

### Example

Run tests for a single image:

```console
$ ./build test versions/gliderlabs-3.2/options
 ✓ version is correct
 ✓ package installs cleanly
 ✓ timezone
 ✓ apk-install script should be available
 ✓ repository list is correct
 ✓ cache is empty
 ✓ root password is disabled

7 tests, 0 failures
```

Run all tests:

```console
$ ./build test
 ✓ version is correct
 ✓ package installs cleanly
 ✓ timezone
...
 ✓ apk-install script should be missing
 ✓ repository list is correct
 ✓ cache is empty
 ✓ root password is disabled

84 tests, 0 failures
```

Run tests in parallel with the `parallel` utility:

```console
$ parallel ./build test ::: versions/**/options
1..7
ok 1 version is correct
ok 2 package installs cleanly
ok 3 timezone
ok 4 apk-install script should be available
...
```

## Library

These are the steps we use for updating the official library image:

1. Merge the `master` branch into `release` and push `release`. This will trigger CircleCI to push resulting image tarballs to the `rootfs/*` branches and push the `gliderlabs` organization images directly to Docker Hub.
1. Verify [the build is green in CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/gliderlabs/docker-alpine/tree/release).
1. Fork the [official images repository][official] and clone it locally if you have not already done so.
1. Create a new local branch in the `docker-library/official-images` repository for the update to alpine.
1. Open the `library/alpine` file from `docker-library/official-images`.
1. Run `./build library` from the `gliderlabs/docker-alpine` folder root to copy the latest version references.
1. Paste in the updated version references to the `library/alpine` file opened in the `docker-library/official-images` local clone.
1. Commit and push the changes to your fork.
1. Open a pull request to the [official images repository][official].
